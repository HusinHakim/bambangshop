## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1. In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. However, in this BambangShop case, a single Model struct is sufficient instead of using an interface (or trait in Rust). This is because we have a simple, uniform implementation for all subscribers - they all have the same attributes (url and name) and behavior. If we needed to support different types of subscribers with varying behaviors or attributes, then a trait would be beneficial to establish a common contract while allowing for different implementations. But since our subscribers all follow the same pattern and there's no polymorphic behavior needed, a struct is adequate and simpler.

2. Using DashMap (map/dictionary) is necessary rather than Vec (list) for this case because we need efficient lookups by unique identifiers. With a Vec, finding a specific subscriber would require iterating through the entire collection (O(n) time complexity), which becomes inefficient as the number of subscribers grows. DashMap provides O(1) lookup time complexity using the unique URL as the key, making operations like retrieving, updating, or deleting a specific subscriber much more efficient. Additionally, our repository is organized with a two-level map structure (product_type -> url -> Subscriber) which naturally fits a map data structure better than a list.

3. While we could implement the Singleton pattern instead of using DashMap, DashMap provides both thread safety and efficient concurrent access that would be challenging to implement manually. In Rust's ownership model, implementing a thread-safe singleton can be complex. DashMap handles concurrent read/write operations safely without blocking (lock-free), which is important for a system where multiple requests might access the subscriber list simultaneously. It combines the Singleton concept (we have a single global SUBSCRIBERS instance) with thread-safety guarantees. Implementing our own thread-safe singleton would likely require using mutex locks and more complex code, potentially with lower performance. DashMap provides a more elegant and efficient solution that aligns with Rust's emphasis on safe concurrency.
